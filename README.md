This is a short, personal project I worked for on the night of November 10, 2022. It is a game engine for the popular board game Reversi, which has several useful functions to be implemented in any user interface of a coder's choosing. 

I coded this project out of boredom and love for the game, and the entire project took ~2 hours to implement.
